# Analysis Notes

## TODO

- [x] Markup intervals #1
- [x] Markup intervals #2
- [x] Find out which ones are consonance or dissonance
- [x] Mark whether intervals are consonance or dissonance #1
- [x] Mark whether intervals are consonance or dissonance #2
- [x] Look at example markup to see what else there is to write on score
- [x] Mark cadences

### Things to write on score

- Mark Passing Tones
- Suspensions

### Consonances / Dissonances

- Consonant: Unisons, 8, 5, 3, 6
- Dissonant: 2, 7, 4

## Questions and Answers

- How are the works structured? How would you divide them into sections? On what basis?
  - TODO:
- What is the mode of each piece? Key signature?
  - 1: Looks like G Dorian, Key signature has a B-flat
- How do these composers use *musica ficta* (implied sharps and flats)?
  - 1: The very last cadence has an F-sharp, then resolves on a unison G
  - 2: *musica ficta* in measure 57, F-sharp to resolve to G octave in measure 58
- How are consonances used? How about dissonances? (What kind of dissonances? Describe them.)
  - TODO: consonances, what are the intervals; dissonances, what are the intervals?
    - TODO:
- Are these two works metrically the same?
  - 1: cut whole, two whole notes per measure
  - 2: also cut whole, two whole notes per measure
  - YES
- What are the rhythms like?
  - TODO: and what kind of rhythms am I trying to describe here? syncopations?
