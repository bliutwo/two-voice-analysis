# Analysis Notes

## TODO

- [x] Markup intervals #1
- [x] Markup intervals #2
- [x] Find out which ones are consonance or dissonance
- [x] Mark whether intervals are consonance or dissonance #1
- [x] Mark whether intervals are consonance or dissonance #2
- [x] Look at example markup to see what else there is to write on score
- [x] Mark cadences

### Things to write on score

- Where does imitation begin?
- Mark Passing Tones
- Suspensions
- [x] The [link](http://openmusictheory.com/embellishingTones.html) has a lot of useful definitions
- NT = Non-Tone?
  - [x] **ANSWER**: [NON-CHORD TONE](https://i.imgur.com/O1siCzX.png)
  - [x] **ALSO**: [NEIGHBOR TONE](https://i.imgur.com/QoytSSq.png)
- [ ] Find out and write definition / criteria for passing tone
  - [x] here is the [image for passing tone](https://i.imgur.com/z3GRNWd.png)
- [ ] Find out and write definition / criteria for suspensions
  - Looks like "Guidelines for Cadences for Two Voices in Examples" has examples
  - [ ] take a look there, `wk2 tues`, and write some notes for that
  - [ ] "Guidelines for Two-Voice Writing" in `wk2 tues`
- [ ] Find out what NT means, and what the def / crit are
- [ ] Mark imitation begin #1
- [ ] Mark imitation begin #2
- [ ] Mark Passing Tones #1
- [ ] Mark Passing Tones #2
- [ ] Mark Suspensions #1
- [ ] Mark Suspensions #2

### Consonances / Dissonances

- Consonant: Unisons, 8, 5, 3, 6
- Dissonant: 2, 7, 4

## Questions and Answers

- How are the works structured? How would you divide them into sections? On what basis?
  - TODO:
- What is the mode of each piece? Key signature?
  - #1: Looks like G Dorian, Key signature has a B-flat
- How do these composers use *musica ficta* (implied sharps and flats)?
  - #1: The very last cadence has an F-sharp, then resolves on a unison G
  - #2: *musica ficta* in measure 57, F-sharp to resolve to G octave in measure 58
- How are consonances used? How about dissonances? (What kind of dissonances? Describe them.)
  - TODO: consonances, what are the intervals; dissonances, what are the intervals?
    - TODO:
- Are these two works metrically the same?
  - #1: cut whole, two whole notes per measure
  - #2: also cut whole, two whole notes per measure
  - YES
- What are the rhythms like?
  - TODO: and what kind of rhythms am I trying to describe here? syncopations?
